This is a Functional Movement Screen app designed to track users' set of exercises performed and provide score to them on the basis of body parts movement. This would use mediapipe and openCV to track different landmarks and angles between them. It would then evaluate and provide score on the range of 1 -3 3 being the fit position. 

Its an ongoing project so I will keep updating it. I aim to develop an app for this project so that it would be easier and convennient for everyone to track their fitness.
